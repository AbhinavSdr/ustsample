Compilation Process:
    1. Converts entire source code into machine code before execution.
    2. Done in a single step, resulting in an executable file.
    3. Faster execution, as machine code is directly executed by the hardware.
    4. Errors detected at compile-time, before execution.
    5. Commonly used in languages like C and C++

Interpretation Process:
    1. Translates and executes code line-by-line or statement-by-statement.
    2. Interpretation occurs every time the program is run.
    3. Slower execution, as translation happens during runtime.
    4. Errors detected at runtime, during execution.
    5. Commonly used in languages like Python and JavaScript
