Comparison: Python and Java

Python
    Strengths:
        1. Clean and easy to read syntax
        2. Code is more concise and requires fewer lines than java for same functionality
        3. Fast development cycles due to concise code and availability of multiple libraries
    Weaknesses:
        1. Slower than compiled languages like Java due to interpreted nature

Java
    Strengths:
        1. Faster execution since it's compiled language
        2. Write once, run anywhere due to JVM
    Weaknesses:
        1. Complexity; more verbose syntax which makes it harder to learn and Write
        2. Longer development cycles compared to Python
